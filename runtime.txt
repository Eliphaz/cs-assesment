The functions are different speeds because of unshift()/push(), push just adds something to the end of an array, modifying a single peice of memory (O(1)). Unshift adds something to the beginning of an array, in the process moving evertthing in the array down one (O(n). For this reason the function that uses push() scales astronomically better.
